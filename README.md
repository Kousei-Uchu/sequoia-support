# Sequoia Support Profiles
Sequoia Profiles is an open-source platform for storing and displaying your needs!
Designed for individuals with hidden disabilities, by someone with lived experience.

I always want to design something to help users with hidden disabilities, and put my skills to use. This project was made as kind of a learning experience for me, I don't have much knowledge of HTML, JS, CSS, and those things so this project is a way for me to learn new code languages.
I usually code apps in Swift, but I wanted to make an app usable by anyone. I'm a strong believer that if you see a way to help, use your skills and do so. If Sequoia Profiles helps even just one person, it's done its job.
Enough about me, now onto the app.

## About
Sequoia Support Profiles is a web application designed to make it easier for you to share your sensitivities and support plans with anyone you wish!
Unfortunately, you currently need access to have a Github account to create a profile. Eventually this will be improved upon, but for now, this is a limitation I have.

## Security
Your data is accessible by anyone on the internet, if they know your Github Username, other auth methods will come down the line. Your data is stored on a Github Repo, and the only way anyone can mass-access data is if they have my account, or have my API access key. For being accessible easily if you are in strife, this is as secure as I can get it with my current knowledge.

## Issue Reports, Suggestions, Questions
If you have a suggestion, need to report an issue, have any questions, or things like that, you can open an issue in the 'Issues' tab.

### Thank you for your interest in Sequoia Profiles!
